# react-native-tech-task
This application has been developed using Expo and React Native.
I have implemented URL checking for a specific URL, as it was a requirement in the tech task. 
When the user clicks on the "Wrong URL" or "Start Quiz" button, they will be redirected to the QuizScreen, and the game will commence.

By clicking the "Correct URL" button, a WebView will open the specified website.
After completing a game, the user can view their results, which include previous games and the current one. These results are stored using Async Storage.

Additionally, there is an option to start a new game by clicking the button. 
I have also installed and integrated SDKs for Appsflyer, Firebase, and OneSignal, even though I did not utilize them, as they were not required for this project.
